# TISK – Text Insert Short-Keys Automation

Version: **1.0.3**

## 💡 What is TISK?

TISK lets you define your own short-keys to allow you type faster (e.g., `_hi` → `Dear Customer,`).

Expands user-defined short-key sequences into full phrases when typing, based on your own shortcuts and groups — or just converted script from AutoHotKeys (which is no longer supported properly in Windows 11, e.g. very slow, missing characters, waiting in one window to finish, etc.). Even if you continue to use and for you AHK works well, you can also use the benefits of TISK.

Clean design, intuitive UI (User Interface), focus on UX (User Experience), browser accessibility, fast, productive, groups logic, and enjoyable to use even if not handle tool or website you use can generate what you want in own tool filter edit field.

## 📌 Current version includes:

- Automatic replacement of the defined sequence of characters with a text string in any form including multi-line.
- Compatibility with Firefox, Chrome and most standard web tools, forms and editing fields.
- Tool available in any corner offering to paste sequence along with the dynamic search filter for drop-down list.
- Auto-extendable search filter field for larger and multi-lines sequences -> µEditor, with resizing point.
- Hide/show toggle button as it is in every modern solution.
- Full positioning tool for page corners with simple buttons.
- Short-Keys grouping that allows you to create categories or multi-language shortcuts.
- Memorize the position, selected group and hidden state of the tool when refreshing pages.
- Trigger short-keys sequences after space or enter key at the end.
- Optional dynamic tags: `%DateStamp%`, `%TimeStamp%`, `%URL%`
- ⚠️ Not yet compatible with Messenger, Gmail, Yahoo, etc.
